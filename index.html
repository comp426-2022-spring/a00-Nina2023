The purpose of this is assignment is to get familiar with the tools that we will be using in COMP 426 for the rest of the semester as well as the assignment submission process.

Note that this first assignment, a00, is graded only for general completion. Future assignments will be much deeper in scope, and you should expect to spend significantly more time on them.

Install Required Software
Below are links to guides for installing the required software for this course. It is all free software and it is mostly open source software, with the exception of Chrome. Chrome is built on the Google’s open source Chromium code base, BUT Chrome itself is licensed as proprietary software.

You are not expected to purchase software for this course.

This software must be installed on your computer not only so you can complete the assignments, but also so you can receive help in office hours.

You will be installing the following:

Chrome (web browser)
Node.js (Javascript Runtime)
git (version control/wofkflow management)
bash (command shell) - Windows users will need to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux. MacOS and Linux users will already have this installed.
VSCode / VIM (text editor)
You do not have to use a specific text editor for this class. HOWEVER, you should use a code editor that has good syntax highlighting.

I encourage you to install and learn VIM in addition to or instead of VSCode.

Visual Studio Code is recommended for COMP 426 as it is installable cross-platform and is also configured as the default IDE for our GitHub classroom assignments.

Whenever you are installing software for development purposes, you should pay attention to version and backward compatibility.

Understand the difference between current or latest versions and the Long Term Support (LTS) versions of packages you are using.

In this course we will use the current Node LTS version 16.13.2 (LTS). Node flipped from 14 as the LTS version to 16 in November 2021, so some techniques might need adapting but we will deal with that as it comes.

My recommendation is that you use a Node version manager of some kind to install and manage Node. It makes knowing what version you are using and keeping it up-to-date a lot easier.

A note on installing software
I am not going to labor over teaching you to install software in this class.

You are in a programming class. It is my expectation that you have, at the very minimum, the ability to understand how to install and configure software.

The instrutional staff is happy to help you if you run into snags, but bear in mind that before you come to us with questions related to software installation and management, you should have exhausted all available resources in the form of documentation and reading (and Googling) error messages, etc.

This is your first opportunity for a bit of “Physician, healh thyself,” in this class.

You can do these things. You can FIGURE OUT HOW to do these things.

I believe in you.

Windows
If you are running Windows, follow the Windows setup guide.

REMEMBER: if you are using Windows, it is super important that you pay special attention to installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

This will allow you to run a Linux development environment, which is hugely helpful to you as a skill, and also makes teaching this course more straightforward, because everyone will have access to a UNIX-like system to develop on.

Mac
If you have a Mac running OSX, follow the Mac setup guide.

Linux
If you run Linux, and you don’t already have the above list installed, you can follow the Linux setup guide.

Join GitHub classroom
Make sure you are logged into GitHub: https://github.com/login If you do not have a GitHub account, then create one and log in.
Use the assignment link for this assignment provided in Sakai to join the GitHub classroom.
When you follow invite link, you will be presented with a list of email addresses. Find your email address in the list and select it.
On the next page, click the green button that says “Accept this assignment.”
Read the text on the page that follows. It will say that it is configuring your repository and that you should refresh the page.
Refresh the page.
You will now see a page that shows a link to your repository. NB: This repository doesn’t exist under your GH account directly, but under the “organization” that owns the GitHub Classroom (jdmar3-comp426).
Open the link to your repository page for a00, which should have the form of https://github.com/jdmar3-comp426/a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME.
Set Up Workspace
Now that you have installed all the preqrequisite software and joined our GitHub classroom, you can create your workspace and organize yourself for class.

Our recommendation is that you create a directory called “comp426” or something similar which you will use to keep all of your work in.

You will have a repository for each assignment and so you can use this directory to clone all of your repos into.

Some of the assignments have their own starter code and some are just blank repos that you will commit your code to and then push back up to GitHub.

Clone the starter code repo
There are multiple ways to clone a repo and get yourself up and running.

Below we will detail doing this in VSCode and in a Bash shell.

VSCode
Open Visual Studio Code (You can also do this by clicking on the VSCode button right in your repo page. You will have to authorize VSCode to use your GH account to install a GitHub Classroom plugin.)
Click the Explorer tab on the left. You will see a button that says “Clone Repository” (hopefully).
Follow the prompts for authorizing VSCode to use your GH account.
You should see a bar at the top that says “Provide repository URL or pick a repository source.”
Go back to your repository page for your repository and click the green button that says “Code.”
Copy the repo link.
Paste the link into the repository bar and press enter.
It will prompt you for a location to clone the repo into.
Once it is cloned, VSCode will ask if you want to open the cloned repository. Open it.
You should now see the contents of your repository in VSCode.
BASH
$ cd Documents
$ mkdir comp426
$ cd comp426
$ git clone https://github.com/jdmar3-comp426/`a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME`.git
Cloning into 'a00-johnmar3'...

$ cd a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME
$ ls
Et voila! You are in the directory containing your repository! You should be able to see the base files in the repository after your ls command. Now you can open in it whatever editor you wish.

Create a demo project
After completing the last section, your computer should be set up for developing websites in COMP 426! Let’s run through a quick demo to make sure everything works.

For this demo, we’re going to pretend we’re starting a new web dev project. We’ll set up a new project directory using npm and Visual Studio Code. Pay close attention to this process, because you’ll want to repeat it every time you start working on a new COMP 426 assignment that does not already have a packages.json file in it. In fact, this process can even be used outside of class in the real world to get set up working on new web-based projects.

Create a project directory and initialize with npm
The first step for starting a new project is usually to create a new folder that will store your project code. However, for this assignment and for others, you will already have a directory created when you clone your assignment repo. You can see these folders in the left side panel of Visual Studio Code, which shows the file explorer.

The file explorer can be toggled open or closed by clicking on the pictured icon.

The explorer icon in Visual Studio Code
If you were going to be creating a new project folder, you could do it by right clicking in the empty space at the bottom of the explorer and clicking “New Folder.” However, for this demo we will just use the existing folder a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME.

Next, right click on the folder a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME and click “Open in Terminal.” This will open a new terminal window pointing at the a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME folder. This raises an important fact about terminals—they always point to a specific folder location in your computer. Usually, the terminal prompt will give some indication of which folder it is currently pointing at. For instance, you might see something like this:

your-computer-name:`a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME` yourname$ 
The important thing here is a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME, which indicates that you are currently in the a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME folder.

There is a special terminal command, pwd, which tells you exactly which folder the terminal is currently in. pwd stands for “print working directory.” Try running pwd in your terminal window now, and verify that it is pointing to the a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME folder.

$ pwd
/home/YOURUSERNAME/Documents/comp426/`a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME`
Whenever you are working on a particular assignment, it is absolutely crucial that you run any related terminal commands from inside the assignment’s folder.

Once you have confirmed that your terminal is pointing to the a00 folder, run the command npm init. This command tells npm to create a brand new web project in the current folder. As part of the initialization process, it’ll ask you a long list of questions about your new web project. It’s okay to just press enter through all the prompts.

$ npm init
What does running npm init actually do? It’s actually pretty simple: it just creates a new package.json file in the current directory. The package.json file is npm’s version of a configuration file for your entire web project. It includes lots of valuable information about your project including the project’s name, version, description, and author. It also includes a list of the dependencies that your project relies on, and a list of custom scripts, or actions, that may be a part of your web application. The answers you type to the questions asked during the npm init process are used to add more information to the package.json file that is created for your project.

At this point, the a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME folder should now have a brand new package.json file with the following contents:

{
  "name": "a00",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
Add some HTML
Next, let’s add some html. Right click on the a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME folder, select “New File,” and name the new file index.html.

Write (do not copy and paste) the following code into the new file and save:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>  
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Alphabet</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>
